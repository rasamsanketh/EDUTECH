# Edutech (Student-Teacher Learning Task Manager)

This workspace contains two folders: `backend` (Node + Express + Mongoose) and `frontend` (Vite + React).

Follow each subfolder's README for setup and run instructions. The backend uses JWT auth and role-based access (student/teacher). The frontend is a minimal UI to signup/login and manage tasks.
